# StoneNeedle


StoneNeedle is a tool, which runs in the Linux kernel environment (later than v3.13), and statistic the I/O workload profiling data. It will show the statistical value to Linux user space applications via the Linux proc file system. We hope, and expect, that these techniques and data will enable many further I/O optimizations to extend HPC and Cloud computing in datacenter into the exascale era and beyond.
