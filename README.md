# StoneNeedle


StoneNeedle is a tool to capture the storage I/O workload profiling data on NVMe SSD devices. It runs in the Linux kernel environment (later than v3.13), and shows the statistical values to Linux user space applications via the proc file system. We hope, and expect, that these techniques and data will enable many further I/O optimizations to extend HPC and Cloud computing in datacenter into the exascale era and beyond.
